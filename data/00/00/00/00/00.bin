约翰·F·沃克
John F. Walker,

10
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,990
你自此被剥夺
you are hereby stripped of

11
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:06,670
美国队长的头衔和权威
your title and authority as Captain America,

12
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:08,400
即刻生效
effective immediately.

{\an8}前情提要

14
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,250
所有人能拿多少拿多少
Everybody, grab what you can.

15
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,300
权力掮客的人最终会逮到我们的
Power Broker will catch up with us eventually right?

16
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,450
我已经在赎罪补过了
I've been making amends.

17
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,150
不  你不是在补过  你只是在复仇
No. You weren't amending, you were avenging.

18
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,050
你想爬出你身处的地狱  那就努力
You want to climb out of that hell you're in, do the work.

19
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,660
我坐牢的时候她死了
She died while I was in jail.

20
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:28,470
他们永远不会让一个黑人当美国队长的
They will never let a Black man be Captain America.

21
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,710
你真要让艾赛亚·布莱德利影响到你吗
You gonna let Isaiah Bradley get in your head?

22
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:33,930
换作我是他  我也会有相同感受
If I was in his shoes, I'd probably feel the exact same way.

23
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,630
但如果我没有站起来继续战斗的决心
But what would be the point of all the pain and sacrifice

24
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,000
那些痛苦和牺牲又有什么意义
if I wasn't willing to stand up and keep fightin'?

25
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:42,150
我们要破坏全球回归委员会的投票
We will ensure the GRC vote never happens.

26
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,530
-我只是来杀猎鹰的  -你会得到机会
- I'm only here to kill the Falcon. - You'll get your chance.

27
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,870
今晚  我们开战
Tonight, we go to battle.

28
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,050
运动已经准备好了
The movement is ready.

29
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,060
他们不会停手的
They're not going to stop.

30
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,920
除非我们逼他们停下
Not unless we make them.

31
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,220
是时候了
It's time.

There's a complete lockdown at the GRC meeting in Lower Manhattan

35
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,800
当局称  正在追踪多个威胁
where authorities are saying they're tracking multiple threats

36
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,790
这些群体有意阻止委员会关于全球安置的投票
from groups seeking to stop the GRC's vote on global resettlement.

37
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,540
已施行了禁飞区
There is a no-fly zone in effect... 

38
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,290
纽约警局已暂时控制了该区域
...and the NYPD has the area secured for the moment.

39
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,760
所有人都被敦促不要靠近
Everyone is urged to stay clear.

40
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,550
我快到了
I'm almost there.

41
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,360
怎么打算的
What's the plan?

42
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,770
卡莉肯定就在附近
Karli's gotta be close.

43
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,010
-眼睛睁大  -可能是任何人
- Keep your eyes open. - Well, it could be anybody.

44
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,760
巴恩斯中士
Sergeant Barnes.

45
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,450
对了  我联系了支援
And by the way, I called in some backup.

46
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,160
不好意思  先生  你没走错地方吗
Excuse me, sir. Are you supposed to be here?

47
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,410
是我
It's me.

48
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,970
莎伦  你怎么在这里
Sharon, what the hell are you doing here?

49
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,590
放松  这里没人会盯着我
Relax. No one's looking for me here.

50
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,870
-你刚刚是说莎伦吗  -很不幸  是的
- Do I hear Sharon? - Unfortunately.

51
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,790
山姆  我想跟大家团聚
Hey, Sam. I thought I'd get the band back together.

52
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,180
谢谢  你来这里冒了很大险
Thank you. You're risking a lot coming here.

53
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,610
我听说赦免也没那么好
I hear pardons aren't all they're cracked up to be anyway.

54
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:02,530
要看治疗师是谁了
Depends on the therapist.

55
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,060
他们很快就会冲击大楼  做好准备
They gonna move on the building soon. Be ready.

56
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:14,170
他来了  动手
He's here. Do it now.

57
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,310
头低下  往门那边去  先生
Keep your head down. Move toward the door, sir.

58
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,420
莎伦  巴基  你们那边怎么样了
Sharon, Bucky, what's going on on your end?

59
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,710
没情况  一片安静
Nothing. All quiet.

60
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,300
抱歉  等等  你是谁
I'm sorry, wait. Who are you?

61
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:04,250
-美国队长  -我以为他在月亮上
- I'm Captain America. - I thought Captain America was on the Moon.

62
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,160
没人在往大楼去
No one's moving toward the building.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,340
卡莉没想进来  她想把人都逼出去
Karli's not coming in. She's trying to force everybody out.

64
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,760
-撤离队...  -这是声东击西
- East evac teams... - It's a misdirect.

65
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,330
我们得让大家待在楼里
We gotta keep everybody inside.

66
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,750
你害我赔了好多钱
You cost me a lot of money.

67
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:22,650
不知你的新小鸟服能卖多少钱
I wonder how much I can get for your new bird costume.

68
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,510
或许值一根法棍  和几根薯条
Maybe a baguette and a few French fries.

69
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,630
{\an2}穿袍子的未必是僧人

70
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,650
你们得想想办法
You guys are gonna have to do something.

71
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,200
别让他们离开大楼
Don't let 'em out of the building.

72
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,480
那里就有一个
Here's one of them.

73
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,830
我去找撤离队
I'll get the evac.

74
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,070
伦诺克斯  他们在走东楼梯井下楼
Lennox, they're heading down the east stairwell.

75
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,190
现在是紧急撤离
This is an emergency evacuation.

76
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,150
请前往撤离车辆
Please proceed to your transports.

77
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,000
1组和2组
Groups one and two 

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,340
将在地下室乘坐安全车撤离

79
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,880
3组将在楼顶乘空中支援离开
Group three will leave via air support on the roof.

80
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,230
巴恩斯先生  是卡莉
Mr. Barnes, it's Karli.

81
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:15,630
卡莉
Karli?

82
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,240
你难道没厌倦为错误的一方而战吗  巴恩斯先生
Aren't you tired of fighting for the wrong side, Mr. Barnes?

83
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,660
我经历过这个  丫头
I've done this before, kid.

84
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,790
我知道结局如何
I know how it ends.

85
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,170
我没活下来也不要紧
It doesn't matter if I don't survive this.

86
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,740
我在为比自己更大的事奋斗
I'm fighting for something bigger than myself.

87
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,110
你杀过那么多人
I mean, with all the bodies you've collected,

88
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,770
你有资格说这种话吗
have you been able to say the same?

89
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,060
你觉得我不曾为比自己更重大的事而战吗
You don't think I ever fought for something bigger than myself?

90
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,680
我一直都在这么做  却失败了两次
That's all I ever tried to do. And I failed twice.

91
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,480
你以为你的大业  是这么多牺牲的正当借口
You think your cause justifies all this death,

92
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,440
但最终  那噩梦会永远折磨你
but in the end, the nightmares won't go away.

93
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:42,900
你会记住你杀的每个人
You're gonna remember all the ones you killed.

94
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,340
相信我
Trust me.

95
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,480
别这么做
Don't do this.

96
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:48,780
别走上这条路
Don't go down this path.

97
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,830
如果你是这么想的  这次还是别参与了
If that's how you feel, you should sit this one out.

98
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,330
得了  你知道我做不到
Come on, you know I ain't gonna do that.

99
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,500
谢谢
Well, thank you.

100
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,300
很高兴你接了我的电话  你帮大忙了
I'm glad you took my call. You've been a big help.

101
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,320
该死
Damn it!

102
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,650
人质在途  六分钟到达
Hostages en route. ETA, six minutes.

103
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,150
不是吧  巴基  就交给你一件事
Seriously, Bucky, you had one job.

104
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,390
你担心你的人吧
You worry about your guy. 

105
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,760
天啊  真抱歉
Oh, my... I'm so sorry.

106
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,220
我没看到你  真抱歉
I didn't see you, I'm sorry.

107
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,530
-干掉一个了  -你怎么做到的
- Well, that's one down. - How'd you manage that?

108
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,670
汞蒸汽...还有些别的
Mercury vapor, amongst other things.

109
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,830
正在登机
Boarding now.

110
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,930
你最好快点  山姆
You better speed things up, Sam. 

111
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,070
直升机要起飞了
The chopper's about to take off.

112
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,310
巴基
Bucky!

113
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,240
我又不会飞  那是你的专长
I don't fly, man. That's your thing. 

114
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,080
再会
Au revoir!

115
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,180
前往汇合点  大概八到十分钟到
Moving to the rendezvous, about eight to ten minutes out.

116
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:51,490
红翼  查查里面谁受过飞行训练
Redwing, see if anyone in there has flight training.

117
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,110
老大  伦诺克斯没回应
Boss, Lennox ain't responding.

118
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,100
好吧  我们还来得及离开...
Okay. Well, we can still get out of here before...

119
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,880
不  迭戈在天上  卡车也快到了
No. Diego's in the air. The trucks are almost here.

120
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:16,580
最糟的情况  就是杀了人质
Worst case scenario... we kill the hostages.

121
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:21,080
-我们是要利用他们谈判的  -好阻止投票
- We're supposed to use them to negotiate. - To stop that vote.

122
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,540
不管怎样  世界都会听到我们的声音
Either way, our message gets out to the world.

123
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,180
我们死了也无所谓
It doesn't even matter if we die.

124
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,800
即便没有我们  运动也有力量继续延续
The movement is strong enough to continue without us.

125
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,890
抱有最好的期望  做最坏的打算
Hope for the best. Prepare for the worst.

126
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,590
坚持住  动作快
Hold tight. Move fast.

127
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,810
同一世界
One world.

00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,030
同一世界
One world.

129
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,060
同一类人

00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,990
好啊
Yeah, man!

134
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,730
我们需要分散注意  给他个人去救
We need a diversion. Give him someone to rescue.

135
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,320
-什么意思  -把车烧了
- What do you mean? - Light it up.

136
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:40,810
-救命  -快过来

137
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,440
撑住
Hold on!

138
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,150
快走
Let's go, get moving!

139
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,190
摩根索
Morgenthau!

140
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,830
我们做个了结吧
Let's finish this.

141
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,430
我无意杀你的朋友
I didn't mean to kill your friend.

142
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,490
我没想伤害不重要的人
I don't wanna hurt people that don't matter.

143
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,370
你觉得莱玛的生命不重要吗
You don't think Lemar's life mattered?

144
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,810
对我的抗争不重要
Not to my fight.

145
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,260
我只想要那辆卡车上的人
I just want the people on that truck.

146
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,170
我们得离开这里
We gotta get out of here.

147
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,050
小心  我接住你了
Be careful. I've got you.

148
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,350
走  快走

00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,880
{\an8}未知联系人
戴上耳机

152
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,950

你会开直升机
you know how to fly a helicopter.

154
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:35,170
小子  你可是自己找打
Boy, you just earned this ass-whoopin'.

155
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:40,190
好了  我们接下来要做的事需要抓住完美时机
Okay. What we're gonna do requires perfect timing.

156
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,810
我们倒数五个数
We're gonna count down from five.

157
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:44,770
数到一的时候  你得抓住操控杆
When we get to one, you're gonna grab the control.

158
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,930
明白吗
Okay?

159
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,950

不
No!

166
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,290
好样的
Hell, yeah!

167
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:28,030
那是我们的黑猎鹰  就是他
That's the Black Falcon there. I tell you.

168
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,020
不  那是美国队长
Nah, that's Captain America.

169
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,030
你经历了那么多  居然还信那些星条的鬼话
You of all people bought into that bullshit?

170
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,880
我在做一些不同的尝试  也许你也该试试
I'm trying something different. Maybe you should do the same.

171
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,530
这边
This way.

172
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,570
莎伦  我们在地下
Hey, Sharon. We're underground.

173
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:44,110
我们进入了威廉街的隧道  正往南去
We entered the tunnel on William. Heading south.

174
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,570
看来他们分开走了  就从这里
Looks like they split up. Here.

175
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,160
交给我
I got it.

176
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:38,800
多维奇
Dovich?

177
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,010
多维奇  是你吗
Dovich, is that you?

178
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,660
放下武器  卡莉
Drop your weapon, Karli.

179
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,110
我叫你放下武器
I said drop it.

180
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,860
我对你很失望
I'm disappointed in you.

181
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,550
我也打算说同样的话
That's what I was gonna say.

182
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,170
当初你来马德里坡的时候
You know, when you came to Madripoor,

183
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,070
你让我想起了我年轻的时候
you reminded me of a young me.

184
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:14,000
我收留了你  给了你机会
I took you in, gave you an opportunity,

185
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:16,100
而你却背叛了我
and you betrayed me.

186
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,650
因为你想掌控一个伤害过你的世界
Because you wanted to control a world that hurt you.

187
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,280
但我想改变它
But I wanted to change it.

188
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,110
我对权力或帝国什么的没兴趣
I'm not interested in power or an empire.

189
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,720
-我有更大的梦想  -怎么  就像这样吗
- I have bigger dreams. - What, like this?

190
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,400
回来再跟着我干吧  你们都回来
Come back and work for me again. All of you.

191
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,770
我们一起  可以做出改变
We can make a difference together.

192
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:32,450
你想要我回来只是因为你需要打手
You just want me because you need your muscle back.

193
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:33,630
没有我们超级士兵
Without us Super Soldiers,

194
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:36,290
权力掮客到底还有多少力量
how much power does the Power Broker really have?

195
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,420
比你多
More than you.

196
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,070
原来你就是权力掮客
So, you're the Power Broker.

197
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,610
你雇了巴托克来监视我
You hired Batroc to spy on me.

198
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:52,770
卡莉  你清楚的  我一向准备周全
Karli, you know I'm always prepared.

199
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:54,070
别妨碍我
Get outta my way.

200
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,860
我受够这些勾心斗角的游戏了
I'm done with these games.

201
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,370
{\an2}那么  权力掮客...

202
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:02,400
{\an2}你要付给我...

203
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,910
{\an2}你说的报酬的四倍

204
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,940
四倍  不然...
Four times. Or...

205
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,280
{\an2}我就向全世界公开你的身份

206
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,390
明白吗
Okay?

207
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,880
别想勒索我
I don't do blackmail.

208
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,720
山姆  别过来
Sam, stay back.

209
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,690
接下来呢
So, what's next, huh?

210
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,110
你这次杀了十个人  下次呢  杀一百个吗
You kill ten this time, then, what, a hundred?

211
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,030
什么时候才算完
Where does it end?

212
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,050
拜托了  让我帮你吧
Please, let me help you.

213
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:42,230
别想操控我
Don't try and manipulate me.

214
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,950
卡莉  别
Karli, don't!

215
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,180
我不跟你打
I'm not gonna fight you!

216
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,070
卡莉
Karli...

217
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,960
别起来
Stay down!

218
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,570
不
No.

219
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:19,100
应用显示是这边
The app says it's this way.

220
00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:19,800
{\an8}用户FS105B  在这里会合  东北角

221
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,480
走吧
Let's go.

222
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:29,700
"仁慈总比严刑律法更硕果累累"
"Mercy bears richer fruit than strict justice."

223
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:31,600
这应用很棒
It's a great app.

224
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,490
谢谢
Thank you.

225
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,880
引用林肯的话  不是吧你
Lincoln, really?

226
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,240
名人名言
Great man. Great quote.

227
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,890
从你嘴里说出来可不像
Not when you say it.

228
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,850
还手啊
Fight back!

229
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,200
停下
Stop it!

230
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,730
打我啊  还手啊
Fight me! Fight back!

231
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,710
对不起
I'm sorry.

232
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,880
碎旗者怎么样了
What happened to the Flag Smashers?

233
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,250
政府是什么时候任命你做美国队长的
When did the government make you Captain America?

234
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:23,930
你还叫猎鹰吗
Is it still Falcon?

235
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,590
还是该叫你猎鹰队长
Or is it Captain Falcon?

236
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:29,680
山姆  我代表所有人谢谢你
Sam, thank you so much, from all of us.

237
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,930
真心感谢
Sincerely.

238
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,830
抗击这些恐怖分子  你已经尽了你的责任
You did your part in dealing with those terrorists,

239
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,460
现在该我们了
now we'll do ours.

240
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,400
你们还会继续进行调整边界的工作吗
Are you still going forward with resetting the borders?

241
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,620
我们的维和部队即将开始重新安置民众
Our peacekeeping troops will begin relocating people soon.

242
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,820
恐怖分子只是稍微耽误了我们一下
The terrorists only set us back a bit.

243
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,570
不要再叫他们恐怖分子了
You have to stop calling them terrorists.

244
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:46,610
那我们应该叫他们什么
What else would we call them?

245
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,720
你们的维和部队拿着武器
Your peacekeeping troops carrying weapons

246
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,270
强迫数百万人
are forcing millions of people

247
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,550
进入世界各地的定居点  对不对
into settlements around the world, right?

248
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,360
你们觉得那些人会怎么叫你们
What do you think those people are gonna call you?

249
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,060
这些标签  "恐怖分子"  "难民"  "暴徒"
These labels, "Terrorists," "Refugee," "Thug,"

250
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,780
常被用来回避核心问题  为什么
they're often used to get around the question, why?

251
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:07,180
五年前发生的那些迁移
Those settlements that happened five years ago,

252
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:11,670
政府不得不支持他们  你觉得这样公平吗
do you think it is fair for governments to have to support them?

253
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:12,240
公平
Yes.

254
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,280
还有  那些消失的人回来后
And the people who reappeared

255
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,580
却发现别人在自己家里生活
only to find someone else living in their family home,

256
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,460
他们就应该流离失所吗
they just end up homeless?

257
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,250
我懂你
Look, I get it.

258
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:26,250
但你不明白情况有多复杂
But you have no idea how complicated this situation is.

259
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,170
其实你说得对
You know what? You're right.

260
00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:31,670
那是件好事
And that's a good thing.

261
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:36,900
我们终于有了共同的奋斗目标
We finally have a common struggle now.

262
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,420
好好想想吧
Think about that.

263
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,380
所有求着你的人
For once, all the people who've been begging,

264
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,480
他们求着你感受一下
and I mean, literally begging for you

265
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:47,400
他们每一天有多苦...
to feel how hard any given day is...

266
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,780
现在你知道了
Now you know.

267
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,420
孤立无援是什么感受
How did it feel to be helpless?

268
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:55,280
如果你还记得孤立无援的感觉
Now if you could remember what it was like to be helpless

269
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:59,700
记得面对强大到能抹去地球一半生命的力量的感觉
and face a force so powerful it could erase half the planet,

270
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:04,310
你就知道  你即将产生同样大的影响
you would know that you're about to have the exact same impact.

271
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:08,590
这与简单省事的决定无关  参议员
This isn't about easy decisions, Senator.

272
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,480
你不明白
You just don't understand.

273
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,370
我是一个背负着星条的黑人
I'm a Black man carrying the stars and stripes.

274
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:16,300
我有不明白的
What don't I understand?

275
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:20,410
我每次拿起这盾牌
Every time I pick this thing up,

276
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,560
都知道有几百万人
I know there are millions of people out there

277
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,460
会因此恨我
who are gonna hate me for it.

278
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,600
哪怕是现在  在这里
Even now, here...

279
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:32,530
{\an8}突发新闻
全球回归委员会在纽约投票表决《补丁法》

280
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,370
我都能感觉到
I feel it.

281
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:33,200
他们瞪着我  指责我
The stares, the judgment.

282
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,640
我无法改变
And there's nothin' I can do to change it.

283
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:39,060
但我依然在这里
Yet, I'm still here.

284
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:44,610
没有超级血清  没有金发碧眼
No super serum, no blond hair, or blue eyes.

285
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,400
我唯有一种能力  
The only power I have 

286
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:53,250
相信我们能做得更好
is that I believe we can do better.

287
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,390
如果我们不主动向人们走去
We can't demand that people step up

288
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:59,360
就不能要求他们站出来
if we don't meet them halfway.

289
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,500
你们控制着银行
Look, you control the banks.

290
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,000
你们甚至能改动国界
Shit, you can move borders!

291
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,130
发一封邮件就能摧毁一座森林
You can knock down a forest with an email,

292
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:08,710
打一通电话就能喂饱一百万人
you can feed a million people with a phone call.

293
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,080
但问题是
But the question is,

294
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,310
做决定的时候  你身边的人是谁
who's in the room with you when you're making those decisions?

295
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,490
是你将会影响到的那些人吗
Is it the people you're gonna impact?

296
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,850
还是更多像你一样的人
Or is it just more people like you?

297
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:28,070
这个女孩不惜性命就为了阻止你
I mean, this girl died trying to stop you,

298
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:31,560
却没有人停下来问一问为什么
and no one has stopped for one second to ask why.

299
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,960
你得更像样点  参议员
You've gotta do better, Senator.

300
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,630
你得站出来
You've gotta step up.

301
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:38,220
因为你若不站出来  下一个卡莉就会
Because if you don't, the next Karli will.

302
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,740
而且你肯定不愿面对升级版的她
And you don't wanna see 2.0.

303
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,610
人们那么相信她的大业
People believed in her cause so much

304
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:50,140
甚至帮她反抗世界上最强大的几国政府
that they helped her defy the strongest governments in the world.

305
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:53,110
你们觉得这是为什么
Why do you think that is?

306
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:59,170
你们手中的权力不亚于一个疯狂的神
Look, you people have just as much power as an insane god

307
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,380
或一个误入歧途的青少年所拥有的
or a misguided teenager.

308
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,930
你们要问自己的问题是
The question you have to ask yourself is,

309
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,410
"你们要如何运用这权力"
"How are you going to use it?"

310
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,720
抱歉  我刚才忙着发短信
Sorry, I was, uh, I was texting and so,

311
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,020
我只听到"穿星条的黑人"
all I heard was, um, "A Black guy in stars and stripes."

312
00:31:31,970 --> 00:31:33,300
干得漂亮  队长
Nice job, Cap.

313
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,460
谢了
Thanks.

314
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,010
莎伦
Sharon?

315
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:42,220
你挡住我的光了
Blocking my light.

316
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,600
我们得送你去医院
We gotta get you to a hospital.

317
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,150
她不会听的
She's not gonna listen.

318
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:48,600
这不算我这周最糟糕的经历
It's not the worst thing that's happened to me all week.

319
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:49,940
我就说吧
Told you.

320
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,270
队长
Uh, Cap?

321
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,130
他应该是在叫你
I think he's talking to you.

322
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,320
很遗憾刚才在下面如此收场
Look, I'm sorry for how things ended down there.

323
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:03,490
不管怎么样  你穿这制服很合适
For what it's worth, suit looks good on you.

324
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:05,370
谢了
Thanks.

325
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,950
好了  我们能不能赶紧离开这
All right, look, can we get out of here, please?

326
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,040
我没忘记我的承诺
I didn't forget my promise.

327
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:16,330
怎么了
What's up?

328
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,700
我们发现了
So, we got eyes on the

329
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,950
跌入哈德逊河的最后一名碎旗者
last Flag Smasher that fell into the Hudson.

330
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,180
他受伤了  但还没被击倒  你能帮忙吗
He's hurt but not down. Can you help?

331
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:23,920
随时乐意效劳
Always.

332
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,760
正在确认囚犯是否完成了最终手续
Confirming that prisoners have cleared final processing.

333
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,870
我们要将他们送去孤岛监狱
We are transporting them to the Raft.

334
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,030
同一世界  同一类人
One world. One people.

335
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:22,430
{\an8}孤岛监狱
最高戒备监狱

336
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,600
激进组织碎旗者的四名成员
Four members of the radical group, the Flag Smashers,

337
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,550
在今天被送去重型监狱途中
were killed today in a car bomb attack

338
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:29,620
死于汽车炸弹袭击
as they were being transferred to a high-security prison.

339
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,650
这场爆炸没有嫌犯
There are no suspects in the bombing.

340
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:32,480
该组织之前反对
The group had opposed

341
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,010
全球回归委员会对全球迁移所做的努力
the global relocation efforts of the GRC,

342
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,780
委员会这周刚宣布了对其
who, just this week, had announced changes

343
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:41,400
遣送回国和安置政策进行调整
in their overall policies of repatriation and resettlement.

344
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:49,070
沃克  快看手机
Hey, Walker, check your phone.

345
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:55,700
看样子我们的朋友泽莫笑到了最后  对吗
Looks like our friend, Zemo, kinda got the last laugh, right?

346
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:59,880
就算我亲自策划也不会比现在的结果更好
Couldn't have worked better if I planned it myself.

347
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:04,110
也许就是我策划的  开玩笑的  不是我
Oh. Well, maybe I did. No, I'm kidding, I didn't.

348
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:05,970
或者真是我
Or did I?

349
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,040
总之  这能省去很多繁琐手续
Anyway, it's gonna save people a lot of paperwork

350
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,630
删减隐瞒和销毁文件
and a lot of redacting and a lot of shredding.

351
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,930
他在里面干什么
What is he doing in there?

352
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:25,140
估计是在弄头盔
It's probably the helmet.

353
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:29,270
沃克  好了没  走了
Walker! My God! Let's go!

354
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,100
这才像样
Now, this is more like it.

355
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:43,720
和原来的制服一样  不过是黑色的
It's the same, but black.

356
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,640
-好吧  -对
- Yeah, well... - Yeah.

357
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,300
马上会出现不寻常的情况
Things are about to get weird.

358
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:53,820
到时  我们不需要美国队长
So, when they do, we're not gonna need a Captain America.

359
00:34:55,450 --> 00:35:00,000
我们需要美国密探
We're gonna need a U.S. Agent.

360
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,690
-好极了  -手机别关机
- That's great. - Keep your phone on.

361
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,690
-遵命  小瓦  -别那么喊我
- Will do, Val. - Don't call me that.

362
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:07,380
收到
Copy.

363
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,120
谢谢你
Thank you.

364
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,310
美国密探
U.S. Agent.

365
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,690
我回来了  我回来了
I'm back! I'm back! I'm back! I'm back!

366
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,320
你怎么来了
Hey, what are you doing here?

367
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:48,280
很晚了  快进来  不然会有人报警
It's late, come in before someone call the cops.

368
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:56,130
你怎么会来  今天又不是星期三
What are you doing here? It's not Wednesday.

369
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,640
我必须告诉你一件事
I, uh, I have to tell you something.

370
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,750
是关于你儿子的
About your son.

371
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,520
他是被谋杀的
He was murdered.

372
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:16,680
什么
What?

373
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,930
被冬日战士
By the Winter Soldier.

374
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,090
那是以前的我
And that was me.

375
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,930
为什么
Why?

376
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,370
我当时别无选择
I didn't have a choice.

377
00:36:54,260 --> 00:37:00,750
{\an8}雷纳医生收

378
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:22,090
{\an8}赎罪名单上的人我都划去了
感谢你一直以来的帮助  医生

379
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:10,750
你想怎么样  黑猎鹰
What you want, Black Falcon?

380
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,760
你得懂点礼貌
Hey, you need to learn some manners.

381
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,840
他已经不是猎鹰了
He ain't a Falcon anymore,

382
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,260
但他仍是黑人
but he's still Black.

383
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,880
我看到你在那所做的壮举
I saw what you did out there.

384
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:32,160
其他人似乎也都看到了
And it seems, so did everyone else.

385
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,810
我听说全球回归委员会决定暂停那些计划
I heard the GRC was standing down on those plans of theirs,

386
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:39,170
所以你一定做了正确的事
so you must have done somethin' right.

387
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,650
说实话
I ain't gonna lie.

388
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,650
你很特别
You're special.

389
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:51,390
谢谢你
Thank you.

390
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:57,380
但你当然比不上平权斗士马尔科姆  马丁和曼德拉
I mean, you ain't no Malcolm, Martin, Mandela, but...

391
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,760
这毋庸置疑
No argument there.

392
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,710
但我知道我该做什么
But I know what I've gotta do.

393
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:06,400
黑人美国队长
So, a Black Captain America, huh?

394
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,110
没错
Damn right.

395
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,600
你面临的战斗并不容易  山姆
The fight you taking on ain't gonna be easy, Sam.

396
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,760
是的  我也许会失败
Yeah, I might fail.

397
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,540
甚至会死
Shit, I might die.

398
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:22,300
可是
But...

399
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,570
这国家是我们建立的
We built this country.

400
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,310
我们为之洒过热血
Bled for it.

401
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:30,560
我绝不会允许任何人对我说  我不能为她而战
I'm not gonna let anybody tell me I can't fight for it.

402
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:34,070
尤其是我之前已经有无数人做出过牺牲
Not after what everybody before me went through.

403
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:35,550
包括你
Including you.

404
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,220
该死
Shit.

405
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,660
我差点就信了
I almost bought that.

406
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,080
你到底有没有放松的时候
Man, do you ever lighten up?

407
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:47,880
没有
Nope.

408
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,310
你去梳洗一下吧
Hey, why don't you clean up? There's, um...

409
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,070
我想带你看样东西
Somethin' I wanna show you.

410
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:06,150
我们要去哪
So, uh, where we going?

411
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,730
{\an8}艾赛亚·布莱德利

412
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,830
人们不会忘记你为国家所做的贡献
Now, they'll never forget what you did for this country.

413
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:13,100
永远不会
Never.

414
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:44,680
他在这呢
Oh! There he is!

415
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,940
